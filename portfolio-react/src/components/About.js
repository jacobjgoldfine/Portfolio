          <p>
            This is some stuff about me. I do not want to put anything in depth here right now. I am going to become a
            better coder later. Right now I don't have anything I want to display but I will soon. So this about me
            section really is just a placeholder until I have more under my belt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is a second paragraph that will contain info about me. I want a larger body of work and experience
            before putting a lot of details here. But for now this will do as a placeholder.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>
    </div>
  );
